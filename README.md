# front-end-dev-test

## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part, we would like to learn about your creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.

You will need to have knowledge of some key things before you start:
  - how to run a local server
  - how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles
  - front end web development

We have supplied an optional development server and some development dependencies for this project, but feel free to use the development framework of your choice (e.g. create-react-app, vue cli, etc). You are not required to use the codebase provided in this repository, but feel free to use it! If you choose to use this codebase, you can run the development server using the commands found below:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

<em>NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set it up yourself.</em>

## Instructions

The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (i.e. Rooster Grin as the client).

Please clone this repo and submit a link to the new project's repo along with any instructions for viewing the final product. It is not required to host this project anywhere, but it would be nice to view your project via a link rather than having to run the build locally.

### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  This was a fun project! I've been trying to do things without using any framework lately. For this project, I've used pure CSS, animations and transitions. While, I was not able to follow the provided template completely, but it was a pleasure to work on this project. 

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
  I missed Bootstrap and Materialize for styling grids. Having things done without any framework, was definitely challenging but developer community is great to ask help from. 

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why

  I enjoyed the freedom of technologies in this challenge.
